Saudi Arabian Kahwa (Arabic Coffee)

Ingredients:

2 tablespoons Arabic coffee grounds (lightly roasted coffee beans)
4 cups water
6-8 green cardamom pods (crushed)
1-2 tablespoons rose water (optional)
A few saffron threads (optional)
1-2 teaspoons sugar (optional, to taste)
Instructions:

Boil Water: In a medium saucepan, bring the water to a boil.

Add Cardamom: Add the crushed cardamom pods to the boiling water. Reduce the heat and let it simmer for about 5 minutes to infuse the cardamom flavor.

Add Coffee Grounds: Stir in the Arabic coffee grounds. Let the mixture simmer gently for an additional 10 minutes. Avoid letting it boil over.

Optional Ingredients: If using saffron, add it to the coffee mixture during the last few minutes of simmering. For a floral note, you can also add rose water at this stage.

Sweeten: If you prefer your Kahwa sweetened, stir in the sugar to taste.

Strain and Serve: Pour the coffee through a fine mesh strainer or a coffee filter into a teapot or coffee carafe to remove the grounds. Serve hot in small cups, often with dates or nuts on the side.

Notes:

Arabic coffee is traditionally served in small cups, as itâ€™s meant to be sipped slowly.
The flavor of Kahwa is quite different from Western coffee, with the cardamom and saffron providing a unique taste profile.
