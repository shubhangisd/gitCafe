5. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, stirring just until combined.

6. Gently fold in the diced apples and chopped walnuts.

7. Pour the batter into the prepared baking pan and spread it evenly.

8. Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.

9. Allow the blondies to cool in the pan on a wire rack before cutting into squares.

10. Enjoy your Apple Walnut Blondies!
