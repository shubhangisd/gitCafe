Maple-Oat Sticky Cake

Ingredients:

For the Cake:

1 cup rolled oats
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup brown sugar
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted
1/2 cup pure maple syrup
1 large egg
1/2 cup milk
For the Topping:

1/2 cup pure maple syrup
1/4 cup unsalted butter
1/4 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup chopped pecans (optional)
Instructions:

Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9-inch square baking pan or line it with parchment paper.

In a large bowl, mix together the rolled oats, flour, brown sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.

In another bowl, combine the melted butter, maple syrup, egg, and milk. Stir until well blended.

Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and mix until just combined. The batter will be thick.

Pour the batter into the prepared baking pan and spread it evenly.

Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.

While the cake is baking, prepare the topping. In a small saucepan, combine the maple syrup, butter, and brown sugar. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture comes to a boil and the sugar is fully dissolved.

Remove the topping from the heat and stir in the chopped pecans, if using.

Once the cake is done baking, remove it from the oven and immediately pour the maple topping over the hot cake.

Let the cake cool in the pan for at least 15 minutes before cutting into squares and serving.

Enjoy your Maple-Oat Sticky Cake!
