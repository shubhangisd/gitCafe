Indonesian Coffee

Ingredients:

1/2 cup coarsely ground Indonesian coffee beans (such as Sumatra or Java)
2 cups hot water (just off the boil)
2-3 tablespoons sweetened condensed milk (adjust to taste)
1-2 tablespoons sugar (optional, adjust to taste)
Ice cubes (for iced version)
Instructions:

Brew the Coffee:

Place the coarsely ground coffee in a coffee maker or pour-over dripper. Alternatively, you can use a French press.
Pour the hot water over the coffee grounds. If using a pour-over method, let the water drip through the grounds. If using a French press, let the coffee steep for about 4 minutes before pressing the plunger down.
Sweeten the Coffee:

Stir in the sweetened condensed milk while the coffee is still hot. The amount can be adjusted based on how sweet and creamy you like your coffee. If desired, add additional sugar to taste.
Serve Hot or Cold:

Hot: Pour the coffee into cups and serve immediately.
Iced: If you prefer iced coffee, let the brewed coffee cool slightly, then pour it over ice cubes. Stir in the sweetened condensed milk and additional sugar if desired.
Optional Garnish:

For an extra touch, you can sprinkle a pinch of ground cinnamon or nutmeg on top.
Enjoy:

Indonesian coffee is best enjoyed fresh, with its robust flavor and creamy sweetness.
