Vietnamese Egg Coffee (Cà Phê Trứng)

Ingredients:

For the Egg Cream:

2 large egg yolks
2 tablespoons sweetened condensed milk
1 tablespoon sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional)
For the Coffee:

1 cup strong brewed Vietnamese coffee (or espresso)
1 tablespoon sweetened condensed milk (optional, to taste)
Instructions:

Brew Coffee: Brew a cup of strong Vietnamese coffee or espresso. If using Vietnamese coffee, you can use a traditional drip method (phin) or any method you prefer. If you like, you can sweeten the coffee with additional sweetened condensed milk.

Prepare Egg Cream:

In a mixing bowl, whisk the egg yolks with the sugar until they become light and frothy.
Add the sweetened condensed milk to the egg yolks and continue whisking until the mixture is thick and creamy. If desired, add vanilla extract for extra flavor.
Froth the Egg Mixture:

You can froth the egg mixture using a hand whisk, a hand blender, or an electric mixer. The goal is to get a light, airy texture similar to whipped cream.
Assemble the Drink:

Pour the brewed coffee into a cup or glass.
Gently spoon or pour the egg cream over the coffee, creating a frothy layer on top.
Serve:

Serve immediately. The egg cream is often enjoyed without mixing it into the coffee. You can sip the coffee through the creamy layer or stir it together, depending on your preference.
Notes:

Ensure the eggs are fresh and well-whisked to avoid any raw egg taste.
For safety, you might prefer using pasteurized eggs or egg substitutes, especially if consuming raw eggs is a concern.
